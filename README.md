## Overview

This is a form card made using tailwind.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I learned how to style various input components using tailwindCSS. I also learned some more advanced tailwind features such as using as the [:has] class when styling the radio component.

### Continued development

If I were to redesign this, I would use React with components so that the elements are reusable, and can easily be changed in one spot. I would also fix the error with the padding not working on the bottom.

### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio#styling_radio_inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio#styling_radio_inputs) - This helped me to style the radio button and give it a cool animation.
